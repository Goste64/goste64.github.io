## Website description:

### Purpose 

I made this website for an assignment given out by Coder Academy and in the future to display my work.

### Functionality and Features

My website is currently quite primitive, however it has links to some of my projects and working navigation

### Sitemap

### Screen shots

![desktop](../docs/imagessitescreenshot1)

### Target audience

This will eventually be shown to employers and probably kept on my social media/github.

### Tech Stack

This website is currently using just HTML and CSS(SASS), however in the future I plan on reiterating this website with Rails then Javascript.

## Design Documentation

### Design process

My design process for this was done mainly through wireframes, however as mentioned below I ended up deviating from my original design.

### Wire Framing

Using a wire frame helped me design my website quite a bit, however due to some issues such as having no images to use, I ended up changing the design slightly. I hope to fix this in the future. I also didn't begin the desktop design and left it responsive to mobile.

### Usability considerations

I have tried to implement responsive design to include both desktop and mobile users, but I'm unsure of how great it's been implemented. I would definitely like to improve this in the future.



### Trello

I didn't find trello to be of much use during this solo web development project, however I have found it useful when using it for coding projects

### Mood Board 

I personally didn't find this very useful, but I did find some simularities between things I like and the fonts and color scheme after adding some images into the board.
